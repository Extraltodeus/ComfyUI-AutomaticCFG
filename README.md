# In short:

My own version "from scratch" of a self-rescaling CFG / anti-burn. It ain't much but it's honest work.

No more burns and 160% faster gens with the warp drive node.

Now includes custom attention modifiers and interesting presets as well as temperature scaling.

Also just tested and it works with pixart sigma.

Works with SD3 for as long as you don't use any boost feature / cutting the uncond (it's the same thing). 20 steps works nicely.

# Note:

The presets are interpreted with eval(). Make sure that you thrust whoever sent a preset to you as it may be used to execute malicious code.

# Update:

- Removed and perfected "Uncond Zero" node and moved it to it's [own repository](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/Uncond-Zero-for-ComfyUI/tree/main)
- Removed temperature nodes and set a [repository](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings) for these

# Usage:

### That's it!

- The "boost" toggle will turn off the negative guidance when the sigmas are near 1. This doubles the inference speed.
- The negative strength lerp the cond and uncond. Now in normal times the way I do this would burn things to the ground. But since it is initialy an anti-burn it just works. This idea is inspired by the [negative prompt weight](https://github.com/muerrilla/stable-diffusion-NPW) repository.
- I leave the advanced node for those who are interested. It will not be beneficial to those who do not feel like experimenting.

For 100 steps this is where the sigma are reaching 1:

Note: the warp drive node improves the speed a lot more. The average speed is 160% the normal one if used with the AYS scheduler (check the workflow images).

There seem to be a slight improvement in quality when using the boost with my other node [CLIP Vector Sculptor text encode](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/Vector_Sculptor_ComfyUI) using the "mean" normalization option.

# Just a note:

Your CFG won't be your CFG anymore. It is turned into a way to guide the CFG/final intensity/brightness/saturation. So don't hesitate to change your habits while trying!

# The rest of the explaination:

While this node is connected, this will turn your sampler's CFG scale into something else.
This methods works by rescaling the CFG at each step by evaluating the potential average min/max values. Aiming at a desired output intensity (by intensity I mean overall brightness/saturation/sharpness).
The base intensity has been arbitrarily chosen by me and your sampler's CFG scale will make this target vary.
I have set the "central" CFG at 8. Meaning that at 4 you will aim at half of the desired range while at 16 it will be doubled. This makes it feel slightly like the usual when you're around the normal values.

The CFG behavior during the sampling being automatically set for each channel makes it behave differently and therefores gives different outputs than the usual.
From my observations by printing the results while testing, it seems to be going from around 16 at the beginning, to something like 4 near the middle and ends up near ~7. 
These values might have changed since I've done a thousand tests with different ways but that's to give you an idea, it's just me eyeballing the CLI's output.

I use the upper and lower 25% topk mean value as a reference to have some margin of manoeuver.

It makes the sampling generate overall better quality images. I get much less if not any artifacts anymore and my more creative prompts also tends to give more random, in a good way, different results.

I attribute this more random yet positive behavior to the fact that it seems to be starting high and then since it becomes lower, it self-corrects and improvise, taking advantage of the sampling process a lot more.

It is dead simple to use and made sampling more fun from my perspective :)

You will find it in the model_patches category.

TLDR: set your CFG at 8 to try it. No burned images and artifacts anymore. CFG is also a bit more sensitive because it's a proportion around 8.

Low scale like 4 also gives really nice results since your CFG is not the CFG anymore.

# Updates:

Updated:
- Up to 28.5% faster generation speed than normal
- Negative weighting

05.04.24:

- Updated to latest ComfyUI version. If you get an error: update your ComfyUI

15.04.24

- ~~Added "no uncond" node which completely disable the negative and doubles the speed while rescaling the latent space in the post-cfg function up until the sigmas are at 1 (or really, 6.86%). By itself it is not perfect and I'm searching for solutions to improve the final result. It seems to work better with dpmpp3m_sde/exponential if you're not using anything else. If you are using the PAG node then you don't need to care about the sampler but will generate at a normal speed. Result will be simply different (I personally like them).~~ use the warp drive instead
- To use the [PAG node](https://github.com/pamparamm/sd-perturbed-attention/tree/master) ~~without the complete slow-down (if using the no-uncond node) or at least take advantage of the boost feature:~~
  ~~- in the "pag_nodes.py" file look for "disable_cfg1_optimization=True"~~
  ~~- set it to "disable_cfg1_optimization=False".~~ This is not necessary anymore because the dev modified it already :)
- For the negative lerp function in the other nodes the scale has been divided by two. So if you were using it at 10, set it to 5.

16.04.24

- Added "uncond_start_percentage" as an experimental feature. This allows to start the guidance later as a way to try [Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves
Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07724.pdf). A more accurate implementation [can be found here](https://github.com/ericbeyer/guidance_interval) :)

17.04.24

- reworked the advanced node and cleaned up
- added timing on every options
- add a post-rescale node which allows to fight deep-frying images a bit more forr some special cases
- added a tweaked version of the Comfy SAG node with start/end sliders
- changed start/end sliders, they are related directly to the sigma values and not in percentage anymore. âš 

01.05.24

- Actually working disabled uncond
- Added "warp drive" preset to test it out simply.

03.05.24

- Allows unpatch `turn off the negative` by removing or disconnecting the node.
- added the "Warp drive" node. It uses a new method of my own cooking which uses the previous step to determin a negative. Cutting the generation time by half for approx 3/4 of the steps.
- added example workflows with 10-12 steps but of course you can do more steps if needed. It is not a goal to do less steps in general but also to show it is compatible.

14.05.24:
- fix the little mem leak ðŸ˜€
- temporarily disabled the timed SAG node because an update broke it.
- added node: **preset loader**. Can do what the other can and much more like modify the attention mechanisms! Mostly tested on SDXL ðŸ˜€!
    - Some presets are slower than others. Just like for the perturbed attention guidance for example. Most are just as fast.
    - About some of the presets:
        - For SD 1.5 "crossed conds customized 3" seems amazing!
        - "Enhanced_details_and_tweaked_attention" works better on creative generations and less on characters.
        - "Reinforced_style" does not regulates the CFG, gives MUCH MORE importance to your negative prompt, works with 12 steps and is slightly slower.
        - "The red riding latent" only works with SDXL. It is an almost nonsensical mix of attention tweaks. Best with 12 steps and really nice with creative prompts. Has the tendency to give more red clothings to the characters. Hence the name.
        - "Excellent_attention" is the default settings for the node described below. Don't delete it or the node won't work. ðŸ™ƒ
        - "Potato Attention Guidance" is really nice for portraits of happy people...
        - There are a bunch of others. I've generated examples which you can find in the example grids folder.
    - Most of these have been tested on SDXL. I have very little idea of the effect on SD 1.5
    - The presets are .json files and can contain a string which will go through eval(). âš 
    - Always check what is inside before running it when it comes from someone else! I hesitated to share a preset which would plan a shutdown in 60 seconds named "actually shut down the computer in one minute" to let you be aware but that would bother more than it would be helfpul.
- added node: "**Excellent attention**" developped by myself and based on this [astonishingly easy to understand research paper!](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/temp/blob/main/very_science.jpg) But in short:
   - Just try it. [Do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0).
   - This node allows to disable the input layer 8 on self and cross attention.
   - But also to apply a custom modification on cross attention middle layer 0. The "patch_cond" and "patch_uncond" toggles are about this modification.
   - While the modification is definitely not very ressource costy, the light patch uses less VRAM.
   - The multiplier influences the cross attention and reinforces prompt-following. But like for real. Works better with the "light patch" toggle ON.
   - I have ~~only~~ mostly tested it with SDXL.
   - You can find a grid example of this node's settings in the "grids_example" folder.
   - For some reason the Juggernaut model does not work with it and I have no idea why.
- Customizable attention modifiers:
     - Check the ["attention_modifiers_explainations"](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/ComfyUI-AutomaticCFG/blob/main/workflows/attention_modifiers_explainations.png) in the workflows. ðŸ‘€ It is basically a tutorial.
     - Experiment what each layer really do by using what is basically a bruteforcing node! (the Attention modifiers tester node)
     - This is how you do a [Perturbed Attention Guidance](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/temp/blob/main/PAG.png) for example
